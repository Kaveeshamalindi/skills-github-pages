Artificial Intelligence, commonly known as AI. It is a very interesting and important topic today.

You may have already heard this word, but what does it really mean?

Artificial Intelligence refers to machines or computers that are designed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans. This idea is not new. It has a long history. It goes back to the 1950s. AI can do many different things, such as solve problems, make decisions, translate languages, play games and even create pictures, music and videos. Some AI programs are so smart that they can win games against humans. For example, an AT chess player once won a tournament against a human player.

We use AI every Single day. When we use Google to search
for something, when we talk to Siri, or when YouTube Shows video Suggestions, that is all done by AI. It helps us finish our work faster and easier.

AI is also used in many important fields.

- In healthcare, it helps doctors find diseases early.
- In education, it helps Students learn better and get quick answers.
- In agriculture, it helps farmers to check crops and increase harvests.
- In some countries, there are AI waiters serving food in restaurants and AI lawyers helping with legal work. This shows how much AT is spreading around the world.

In the future, AI will become smarter and more helpful.
If we use it in a good way. It can make our world safer, faster and better for everyone.

“Artificial Intelligence is the new electricity.” — Andrew Ng (Co-founder of Coursera)
